# Dashboard

This is my personal profile page. I wanted to aggregate all of my data
into one place that makes it easy to see who I am online. Would like
something to show strangers when I meet them.

## Technology

I'm doing the site completely in Node, and along the way I'm configuring
an environment that I like to develop in. It's fairly `Rails`-y, which is
simply because that's what I know and happen to like the pattern. Once this
is in a more complete state, I'd like to pull as much of the framework out
into something that I can re-use. I'm looking to use memcached for caching
in the future, but other than that my only dependencies are in my package.json.

I'm also taking this as a chance to work with various APIs of the things I
use.
