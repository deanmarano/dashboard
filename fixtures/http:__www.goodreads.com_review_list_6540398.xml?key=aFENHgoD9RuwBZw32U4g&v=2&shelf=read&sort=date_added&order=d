My name's Frank Chimero. I've spent the better part of the last two years writing and speaking on design and thinking about the topics that orbit the practice: storytelling, concept, craft, and improvisation. I want to take all of the ideas I've had and connected these past few months and capture them in a book format.<br /><br />I've been teaching for the past 5 years, and I've always been a bit frustrated that there isn't a nice, concise book that overviews the mental state of a successful designer while they go through their creative process. For instance, many say that graphic design is visual communication. A cornerstone of communication is storytelling, and yet you'd be hard-pressed to find any discussion of how to tell stories with design in any design book. This should be remedied.<br /><br />There are new challenges in the world that need to be discussed, and I think design is a prime lens to consider these topics. As our world moves faster and as things become less stable, it becomes more important for individuals to embrace ambiguity, understand paradox, and realize that two things can conflict and still somehow both be true. We must realize that logic doesn't always work, and that sometimes nonsense is the best answer. These are the topics I intend to address in the book.<br /><br />The Shape of Design isn't going to be a text book. The project will be focused on Why instead of How. We have enough How; it's time for a thoughtful analysis of our practice and its characteristics so we can better practice our craft. After reading the book, I want you to look at what you do in a whole new light. Design is more than working for clients.<br /><br />But really, this book aims to look at the mindset and worldview that designing develops in order to answer one big, important question: How can we make things that help all of us live better?\""],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["5282324"],"name":["Frank Chimero"],"image_url":["http://www.goodreads.com/assets/nophoto/nophoto-U-200x266-b0aaccaa9663f92f58dd54112a869d72.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://www.goodreads.com/assets/nophoto/nophoto-U-50x66-251a730d696018971ef4a443cdeaae05.jpg"],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5282324.Frank_Chimero"],"average_rating":["3.86"],"ratings_count":["191"],"text_reviews_count":["29"]}]}],"published":[{}]}],"rating":["3"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read"}}]}],"recommended_for":[{}],"recommended_by":[{}],"started_at":["Tue Oct 23 00:00:00 -0700 2012"],"read_at":["Tue Oct 23 00:00:00 -0700 2012"],"date_added":["Tue Oct 23 19:36:07 -0700 2012"],"date_updated":["Tue Oct 23 21:27:01 -0700 2012"],"read_count":[{}],"body":["\n      Some interesting points about why we design, good things to think about.\n  "],"comments_count":["review_comments_count"],"url":["http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/440604797"],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/440604797"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["411510051"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"13481927","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"isbn13":[{"$":{"nil":"true"}}],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"7","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Objects on Rails"],"image_url":["http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1337865856m/13481927.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1337865856s/13481927.jpg"],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13481927-objects-on-rails"],"num_pages":["197"],"format":["ebook"],"edition_information":[{}],"publisher":[{}],"publication_day":[{}],"publication_year":["2012"],"publication_month":[{}],"average_rating":["4.16"],"ratings_count":["57"],"description":[{}],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["4971702"],"name":["Avdi Grimm"],"image_url":["http://www.goodreads.com/assets/nophoto/nophoto-U-200x266-b0aaccaa9663f92f58dd54112a869d72.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://www.goodreads.com/assets/nophoto/nophoto-U-50x66-251a730d696018971ef4a443cdeaae05.jpg"],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4971702.Avdi_Grimm"],"average_rating":["4.16"],"ratings_count":["125"],"text_reviews_count":["14"]}]}],"published":["2012"]}],"rating":["3"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read"}}]}],"recommended_for":[{}],"recommended_by":[{}],"started_at":["Mon Sep 10 00:00:00 -0700 2012"],"read_at":["Tue Oct 30 00:00:00 -0700 2012"],"date_added":["Mon Sep 10 08:23:51 -0700 2012"],"date_updated":["Tue Oct 30 20:42:58 -0700 2012"],"read_count":[{}],"body":[{}],"comments_count":["review_comments_count"],"url":["http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/411510051"],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/411510051"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["384822020"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"6346975","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["159420229X"],"isbn13":["9781594202292"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"1832","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything"],"image_url":["http://www.goodreads.com/assets/nocover/111x148.png"],"small_image_url":["http://www.goodreads.com/assets/nocover/60x80.png"],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6346975-moonwalking-with-einstein"],"num_pages":["320"],"format":["Hardcover"],"edition_information":[{}],"publisher":["Penguin Press HC, The"],"publication_day":["3"],"publication_year":["2011"],"publication_month":["3"],"average_rating":["3.79"],"ratings_count":["18980"],"description":["<strong>Foer's unlikely journey from chronically forgetful science journalist to U.S. Memory Champion frames a revelatory exploration of the vast, hidden impact of memory on every aspect of our lives. </strong> <br /><br /> On average, people squander forty days annually compensating for things they've forgotten. Joshua Foer used to be one of those people. But after a year of memory training, he found himself in the finals of the U.S. Memory Championship. Even more important, Foer found a vital truth we too often forget: In every way that matters, we are the sum of our memories. <br /><br /><em>Moonwalking with Einstein</em> draws on cutting-edge research, a surprising cultural history of memory, and venerable tricks of the mentalist's trade to transform our understanding of human remembering. Under the tutelage of top \"mental athletes,\" he learns ancient techniques once employed by Cicero to memorize his speeches and by Medieval scholars to memorize entire books. Using methods that have been largely forgotten, Foer discovers that we can all dramatically improve our memories. <br /><br /> Immersing himself obsessively in a quirky subculture of competitive memorizers, Foer learns to apply techniques that call on imagination as much as determination--showing that memorization can be anything but rote. From the PAO system, which converts numbers into lurid images, to the memory palace, in which memories are stored in the rooms of imaginary structures, Foer's experience shows that the World Memory Championships are less a test of memory than of perseverance and creativity. <br /><br /> Foer takes his inquiry well beyond the arena of mental athletes-across the country and deep into his own mind. In San Diego, he meets an affable old man with one of the most severe case of amnesia on record, where he learns that memory is at once more elusive and more reliable than we might think. In Salt Lake City, he swaps secrets with a savant who claims to have memorized more than nine thousand books. At a high school in the South Bronx, he finds a history teacher using twenty- five-hundred-year-old memory techniques to give his students an edge in the state Regents exam. <br /><br /> At a time when electronic devices have all but rendered our individual memories obsolete, Foer's bid to resurrect the forgotten art of remembering becomes an urgent quest. <em>Moonwalking with Einstein</em> brings Joshua Foer to the apex of the U.S. Memory Championship and readers to a profound appreciation of a gift we all possess but that too often slips our minds."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["2867569"],"name":["Joshua Foer"],"image_url":["http://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1322436441p5/2867569.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1322436441p2/2867569.jpg"],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2867569.Joshua_Foer"],"average_rating":["3.79"],"ratings_count":["19008"],"text_reviews_count":["2011"]}]}],"published":["2011"]}],"rating":["5"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read"}}]}],"recommended_for":[{}],"recommended_by":[{}],"started_at":["Sun Aug 05 00:00:00 -0700 2012"],"read_at":["Fri Aug 24 00:00:00 -0700 2012"],"date_added":["Sun Aug 05 15:43:33 -0700 2012"],"date_updated":["Wed Aug 29 05:24:26 -0700 2012"],"read_count":[{}],"body":["\n      Fantastic book that delves into the perception of memory, how easy it is to train, and how amazing it can become.\n  "],"comments_count":["review_comments_count"],"url":["http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/384822020"],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/384822020"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["382760121"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"203899","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0062509551"],"isbn13":["9780062509550"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"52","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Letter from the Birmingham Jail"],"image_url":["http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1332729896m/203899.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1332729896s/203899.jpg"],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/203899.Letter_from_the_Birmingham_Jail"],"num_pages":[{}],"format":[{}],"edition_information":[{}],"publisher":[{}],"publication_day":[{}],"publication_year":[{}],"publication_month":[{}],"average_rating":["4.62"],"ratings_count":["724"],"description":[{}],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["23924"],"name":["Martin Luther King Jr."],"image_url":["http://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1198518558p5/23924.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1198518558p2/23924.jpg"],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/23924.Martin_Luther_King_Jr_"],"average_rating":["4.42"],"ratings_count":["8586"],"text_reviews_count":["739"]}]}],"published":[{}]}],"rating":["5"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read"}}]}],"recommended_for":[{}],"recommended_by":[{}],"started_at":[{}],"read_at":["Thu Aug 02 15:14:45 -0700 2012"],"date_added":["Thu Aug 02 15:13:14 -0700 2012"],"date_updated":["Thu Aug 02 15:14:45 -0700 2012"],"read_count":[{}],"body":["\n      Amazingly powerful and a quick read.

Sketching, prototyping, and design are essential parts of the process we use to create new products. Bill Buxton brings design leadership and creativity to Microsoft. Through his thought-provoking personal examples he is inspiring others to better understand the role of design in their own companies--Bill Gates, Chairman, Microsoft <br /> Informed design is essential. While it might seem that Bill Buxton is exaggerating or kidding with this bold assertion, neither is the case. In an impeccably argued and sumptuously illustrated book, design star Buxton convinces us that design simply must be integrated into the heart of business--Roger Martin, Dean, Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto <br />Design is explained, with the means and manner for successes and failures illuminated by engaging stories, true examples and personal anecdotes. In Sketching User Experiences, Bill Buxton clarifies the processes and skills of design from sketching to experience modeling, in a lively and informative style that is rich with stories and full of his own heart and enthusiasm. At the start we are lost in mountain snows and northern seas, but by the end we are equipped with a deep understanding of the tools of creative design.--Bill Moggridge, Cofounder of IDEO and author of Designing Interactions <br /> Like any secret society, the design community has its strange rituals and initiation procedures. Bill opens up the mysteries of the magical process of design, taking us through a land in which story-telling, orange squeezers, the Wizard of Oz, I-pods, avalanche avoidance, bicycle suspension sketching, and faking it are all points on the design pilgrim s journey. There are lots of ideas and techniques in this book to feed good design and transform the way we think about creating useful stuff.\" Peter Gabriel <br />I love this book. There are very few resources available that see across and through all of the disciplines involved in developing great experiences. This is complex stuff and Buxton's work is both informed and insightful. He shares the work in an intimate manner that engages the reader and you will find yourself nodding with agreement, and smiling at the poignant relevance of his examples.--Alistair Hamilton, Symbol Technologies, NY <br />Books that have proposed bringing design into HCI are aplenty, though books that propose bringing software in to Design less common. Nevertheless, Bill manages to skilfully steer a course between the excesses of the two approaches and offers something truly in-between. It could be a real boon to the innovation business by bringing the best of both worlds: design and HCI. --Richard Harper, Microsoft Research, Cambridge <br />There is almost a fervor in the way that new products, with their rich and dynamic interfaces, are being released to the public typically promising to make lives easier, solve the most difficult of problems, and maybe even make the world a better place. The reality is that few survive, much less deliver on their promise. The folly? An absence of design, and an over-reliance on technology alone as the solution. <br />We need design. But design as described here depends on different skillsets each essential, but on their own, none sufficient. In this rich ecology, designers are faced with new challenges challenges that build on, rather than replace, existing skills and practice. <br />Sketching User Experiences approaches design and design thinking as something distinct that needs to be better understood by both designers and the people with whom they need to work in order to achieve success with new products and systems. So while the focus is on design, the approach is holistic. Hence, the book speaks to designers, usability specialists, the HCI community, product managers, and business executives. There is an emphasis on balancing the back-end concern with usability and engineering excellence (getting the design right) with an up-front investment in sketching and ideation (getting the right design). Overall, the objective is to build the notion of informed design: molding emerging technology into a form that serves our society and reflects its values. <br />Grounded in both practice and scientific research, Bill Buxton s engaging work aims to spark the imagination while encouraging the use of new techniques, breathing new life into user experience design. <br /> Covers sketching and early prototyping design methods suitable for dynamic product capabilities: cell phones that communicate with each other and other embedded systems, smart appliances, and things you only imagine in your dreams;<br /> Thorough coverage of the design sketching method which helps easily build experience prototypes without the effort of engineering prototypes which are difficult to abandon;<br /> Reaches out to a range of designers, including user interface designers, industrial designers, software engineers, usability engineers, product managers, and others;<br /> Full of case studies, examples, exercises, and projects, and access to video clips (<a href=\"http://www.mkp.com/sketching\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.mkp.com/sketching</a>) that demonstrate the principles and methods. <br />About the Author <br />Trained as a musician, Bill Buxton began using computers over thirty years ago in his art. This early experience, both in the studio an on stage, helped develop a deep appreciation of both the positive and negative aspects of technology and its impact. This increasingly drew him into both design and research, with a very strong emphasis on interaction and the human aspects of technology. He first came to prominence for his work at the University of Toronto on digital musical instruments and the novel interfaces that they employed. This work in the late 70s gained the attention of Xerox PARC, where Buxton participated in pioneering work in collaborative work, interaction techniques and ubiquitous computing. He then went on to become Chief Scientist of SGI and Alias-Wavefront, where he had the opportunity to work with some of the top film makers and industrial designers in the world. He is now a principal researcher at Microsoft Corp., where he splits his time between research and helping make design a fundamental pillar of the corporate culture. <br />* Covers sketching and early prototyping design methods suitable for dynamic product capabilities: cell phones that communicate with each other and other embedded systems, \"smart\" appliances, and things you only imagine in your dreams; <br />* Thorough coverage of the design sketching method which helps easily build experience prototypes without the effort of engineering prototypes which are difficult to abandon; <br />* Reaches out to a range of designers, including user interface designers, industrial designers, software engineers, usability engineers, product managers, and others; <br />* Full of case studies, examples, exercises, and projects, and access to video clips that demonstrate the principles and methods."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["494245"],"name":["Bill Buxton"],"image_url":["http://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1306726066p5/494245.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://d.gr-assets.com/authors/1306726066p2/494245.jpg"],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/494245.Bill_Buxton"],"average_rating":["3.94"],"ratings_count":["420"],"text_reviews_count":["41"]}]}],"published":["2007"]}],"rating":["3"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read"}}]}],"recommended_for":[{}],"recommended_by":[{}],"started_at":["Tue Mar 27 00:00:00 -0700 2012"],"read_at":["Tue Jun 12 10:59:23 -0700 2012"],"date_added":["Tue Mar 27 17:13:11 -0700 2012"],"date_updated":["Thu Jul 05 10:36:37 -0700 2012"],"read_count":[{}],"body":["\n      More on the theory and reasoning behind why and how to do sketches than the actual instruction I was looking for.\n  "],"comments_count":["review_comments_count"],"url":["http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/301931469"],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/301931469"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["299174241"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"41597","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0321193857"],"isbn13":["9780321193858"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"77","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Non-Designer's Design Book"],"image_url":["http://www.goodreads.com/assets/nocover/111x148.png"],"small_image_url":["http://www.goodreads.com/assets/nocover/60x80.png"],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41597.The_Non_Designer_s_Design_Book"],"num_pages":["191"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[" Second Edition"],"publisher":["Peachpit Press"],"publication_day":["28"],"publication_year":["2003"],"publication_month":["8"],"average_rating":["3.96"],"ratings_count":["1008"],"description":["So you have a great concept and all the fancy digital tools you could possibly require—what's stopping you from creating beautiful pages?

Swift suggests in his essay that the impoverished Irish might ease their economic troubles by selling children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies. By doing this he mocks the authority of the British officials. A Modest Proposal is included in many literature programs as an example of early modern western satire. It also serves as an exceptional introduction to the concept and use of argumentative language, lending itself well to secondary and post-secondary essay courses.

Now he stands ready to revolutionize both neuroscience and computing in one stroke, with a new understanding of intelligence itself.<br /><br />Hawkins develops a powerful theory of how the human brain works, explaining why computers are not intelligent and how, based on this new theory, we can finally build intelligent machines.<br /><br />The brain is not a computer, but a memory system that stores experiences in a way that reflects the true structure of the world, remembering sequences of events and their nested relationships and making predictions based on those memories. It is this memory-prediction system that forms the basis of intelligence, perception, creativity, and even consciousness.<br /><br />In an engaging style that will captivate audiences from the merely curious to the professional scientist, Hawkins shows how a clear understanding of how the brain works will make it possible for us to build intelligent machines, in silicon, that will exceed our human ability in surprising ways.<br /><br />Written with acclaimed science writer Sandra Blakeslee, <em>On Intelligence</em> promises to completely transfigure the possibilities of the technology age. It is a landmark book in its scope and clarity."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["15461"],"name":["Jeff Hawkins"],"image_url":["http://www.goodreads.com/assets/nophoto/nophoto-U-200x266-b0aaccaa9663f92f58dd54112a869d72.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://www.goodreads.com/assets/nophoto/nophoto-U-50x66-251a730d696018971ef4a443cdeaae05.jpg"],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15461.Jeff_Hawkins"],"average_rating":["4.08"],"ratings_count":["1728"],"text_reviews_count":["176"]}]}],"published":["2005"]}],"rating":["5"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read"}}]}],"recommended_for":[{}],"recommended_by":[{}],"started_at":[{}],"read_at":[{}],"date_added":["Sun Oct 23 09:51:56 -0700 2011"],"date_updated":["Sun Oct 23 09:51:56 -0700 2011"],"read_count":[{}],"body":[{}],"comments_count":["review_comments_count"],"url":["http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/226612272"],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/226612272"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["226610736"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"1633","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0142000280"],"isbn13":["9780142000281"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"1619","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity"],"image_url":["http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1312474060m/1633.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1312474060s/1633.jpg"],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1633.Getting_Things_Done"],"num_pages":["288"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[{}],"publisher":["Penguin Books"],"publication_day":["31"],"publication_year":["2002"],"publication_month":["12"],"average_rating":["3.96"],"ratings_count":["23578"],"description":["<br />In today's world, yesterday's methods just don't work.
