The reality is that most innovations come from a process of rigorous examination through which great ideas are identified and developed before being realized as new offerings and capabilities.<br><br>This book introduces the idea of design thinking‚ the collaborative process by which the designer′s sensibilities and methods are employed to match people′s needs not only with what is technically feasible and a viable business strategy. In short‚ design thinking converts need into demand. It′s a human−centered approach to problem solving that helps people and organizations become more innovative and more creative.<br><br>Design thinking is not just applicable to so−called creative industries or people who work in the design field. It′s a methodology that has been used by organizations such as Kaiser Permanente to icnrease the quality of patient care by re−examining the ways that their nurses manage shift change‚ or Kraft to rethink supply chain management.

Jon Ronson's exploration of a potential hoax being played on the world's top neurologists takes him, unexpectedly, into the heart of the madness industry. An influential psychologist who is convinced that many important CEOs and politicians are, in fact, psychopaths teaches Ronson how to spot these high-flying individuals by looking out for little telltale verbal and nonverbal clues. And so Ronson, armed with his new psychopath-spotting abilities, enters the corridors of power.

They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking, reading to partying; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over brainstorming in teams. Although they are often labeled \"quiet,\" it is to introverts that we owe many of the great contributions to society--from van Gogh’s sunflowers to the invention of the personal computer.<br><br>Passionately argued, impressively researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, <em>Quiet </em>shows how dramatically we undervalue introverts, and how much we lose in doing so. Taking the reader on a journey from Dale Carnegie’s birthplace to Harvard Business School, from a Tony Robbins seminar to an evangelical megachurch, Susan Cain charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal in the twentieth century and explores its far-reaching effects. She talks to Asian-American students who feel alienated from the brash, backslapping atmosphere of American schools. She questions the dominant values of American business culture, where forced collaboration can stand in the way of innovation, and where the leadership potential of introverts is often overlooked. And she draws on cutting-edge research in psychology and neuroscience to reveal the surprising differences between extroverts and introverts.<br><br>Perhaps most inspiring, she introduces us to successful introverts--from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Finally, she offers invaluable advice on everything from how to better negotiate differences in introvert-extrovert relationships to how to empower an introverted child to when it makes sense to be a \"pretend extrovert.\"<br><br>This extraordinary book has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how introverts see themselves."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["4101935"],"name":["Susan Cain"],"image_url":["http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1315319296p5/4101935.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1315319296p2/4101935.jpg"],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4101935.Susan_Cain"],"average_rating":["4.03"],"ratings_count":["52880"],"text_reviews_count":["7025"]}]}],"published":["2012"]}],"rating":["5"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read"}}]}],"recommended_for":[{}],"recommended_by":[{}],"started_at":["Mon Jul 01 00:00:00 -0700 2013"],"read_at":["Wed Jul 17 00:00:00 -0700 2013"],"date_added":["Sat Dec 08 19:29:26 -0800 2012"],"date_updated":["Thu Jul 18 06:15:25 -0700 2013"],"read_count":[{}],"body":["\n      Really enjoyed this book.

My name's Frank Chimero. I've spent the better part of the last two years writing and speaking on design and thinking about the topics that orbit the practice: storytelling, concept, craft, and improvisation. I want to take all of the ideas I've had and connected these past few months and capture them in a book format.<br><br>I've been teaching for the past 5 years, and I've always been a bit frustrated that there isn't a nice, concise book that overviews the mental state of a successful designer while they go through their creative process. For instance, many say that graphic design is visual communication. A cornerstone of communication is storytelling, and yet you'd be hard-pressed to find any discussion of how to tell stories with design in any design book. This should be remedied.<br><br>There are new challenges in the world that need to be discussed, and I think design is a prime lens to consider these topics. As our world moves faster and as things become less stable, it becomes more important for individuals to embrace ambiguity, understand paradox, and realize that two things can conflict and still somehow both be true. We must realize that logic doesn't always work, and that sometimes nonsense is the best answer. These are the topics I intend to address in the book.<br><br>The Shape of Design isn't going to be a text book. The project will be focused on Why instead of How. We have enough How; it's time for a thoughtful analysis of our practice and its characteristics so we can better practice our craft. After reading the book, I want you to look at what you do in a whole new light.

Joshua Foer used to be one of those people. But after a year of memory training, he found himself in the finals of the U.S. Memory Championship. Even more important, Foer found a vital truth we too often forget: In every way that matters, we are the sum of our memories. <br><br><em>Moonwalking with Einstein</em> draws on cutting-edge research, a surprising cultural history of memory, and venerable tricks of the mentalist's trade to transform our understanding of human remembering. Under the tutelage of top \"mental athletes,\" he learns ancient techniques once employed by Cicero to memorize his speeches and by Medieval scholars to memorize entire books. Using methods that have been largely forgotten, Foer discovers that we can all dramatically improve our memories. <br><br> Immersing himself obsessively in a quirky subculture of competitive memorizers, Foer learns to apply techniques that call on imagination as much as determination--showing that memorization can be anything but rote. From the PAO system, which converts numbers into lurid images, to the memory palace, in which memories are stored in the rooms of imaginary structures, Foer's experience shows that the World Memory Championships are less a test of memory than of perseverance and creativity. <br><br> Foer takes his inquiry well beyond the arena of mental athletes-across the country and deep into his own mind. In San Diego, he meets an affable old man with one of the most severe case of amnesia on record, where he learns that memory is at once more elusive and more reliable than we might think.

Beginner's mind is the practice of Zen mind. <br><br> This book originated from a series of talks given by Zen Master Shunryu Suzuki to a small group in Los Altos, California. He joined their meditation periods once a week and afterwards answered their questions and tried to encourage them in their practice of Zen and help them solve the problems of life.

Sketching, prototyping, and design are essential parts of the process we use to create new products. Bill Buxton brings design leadership and creativity to Microsoft. Through his thought-provoking personal examples he is inspiring others to better understand the role of design in their own companies--Bill Gates, Chairman, Microsoft <br> Informed design is essential. While it might seem that Bill Buxton is exaggerating or kidding with this bold assertion, neither is the case. In an impeccably argued and sumptuously illustrated book, design star Buxton convinces us that design simply must be integrated into the heart of business--Roger Martin, Dean, Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto <br>Design is explained, with the means and manner for successes and failures illuminated by engaging stories, true examples and personal anecdotes. In Sketching User Experiences, Bill Buxton clarifies the processes and skills of design from sketching to experience modeling, in a lively and informative style that is rich with stories and full of his own heart and enthusiasm. At the start we are lost in mountain snows and northern seas, but by the end we are equipped with a deep understanding of the tools of creative design.--Bill Moggridge, Cofounder of IDEO and author of Designing Interactions <br> Like any secret society, the design community has its strange rituals and initiation procedures. Bill opens up the mysteries of the magical process of design, taking us through a land in which story-telling, orange squeezers, the Wizard of Oz, I-pods, avalanche avoidance, bicycle suspension sketching, and faking it are all points on the design pilgrim s journey. There are lots of ideas and techniques in this book to feed good design and transform the way we think about creating useful stuff.\" Peter Gabriel <br>I love this book. There are very few resources available that see across and through all of the disciplines involved in developing great experiences. This is complex stuff and Buxton's work is both informed and insightful. He shares the work in an intimate manner that engages the reader and you will find yourself nodding with agreement, and smiling at the poignant relevance of his examples.--Alistair Hamilton, Symbol Technologies, NY <br>Books that have proposed bringing design into HCI are aplenty, though books that propose bringing software in to Design less common. Nevertheless, Bill manages to skilfully steer a course between the excesses of the two approaches and offers something truly in-between. It could be a real boon to the innovation business by bringing the best of both worlds: design and HCI. --Richard Harper, Microsoft Research, Cambridge <br>There is almost a fervor in the way that new products, with their rich and dynamic interfaces, are being released to the public typically promising to make lives easier, solve the most difficult of problems, and maybe even make the world a better place. The reality is that few survive, much less deliver on their promise. The folly? An absence of design, and an over-reliance on technology alone as the solution. <br>We need design. But design as described here depends on different skillsets each essential, but on their own, none sufficient. In this rich ecology, designers are faced with new challenges challenges that build on, rather than replace, existing skills and practice. <br>Sketching User Experiences approaches design and design thinking as something distinct that needs to be better understood by both designers and the people with whom they need to work in order to achieve success with new products and systems. So while the focus is on design, the approach is holistic. Hence, the book speaks to designers, usability specialists, the HCI community, product managers, and business executives. There is an emphasis on balancing the back-end concern with usability and engineering excellence (getting the design right) with an up-front investment in sketching and ideation (getting the right design). Overall, the objective is to build the notion of informed design: molding emerging technology into a form that serves our society and reflects its values. <br>Grounded in both practice and scientific research, Bill Buxton s engaging work aims to spark the imagination while encouraging the use of new techniques, breathing new life into user experience design. <br> Covers sketching and early prototyping design methods suitable for dynamic product capabilities: cell phones that communicate with each other and other embedded systems, smart appliances, and things you only imagine in your dreams;<br> Thorough coverage of the design sketching method which helps easily build experience prototypes without the effort of engineering prototypes which are difficult to abandon;<br> Reaches out to a range of designers, including user interface designers, industrial designers, software engineers, usability engineers, product managers, and others;<br> Full of case studies, examples, exercises, and projects, and access to video clips (<a href=\"http://www.mkp.com/sketching\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.mkp.com/sketching</a>) that demonstrate the principles and methods. <br>About the Author <br>Trained as a musician, Bill Buxton began using computers over thirty years ago in his art. This early experience, both in the studio an on stage, helped develop a deep appreciation of both the positive and negative aspects of technology and its impact. This increasingly drew him into both design and research, with a very strong emphasis on interaction and the human aspects of technology. He first came to prominence for his work at the University of Toronto on digital musical instruments and the novel interfaces that they employed. This work in the late 70s gained the attention of Xerox PARC, where Buxton participated in pioneering work in collaborative work, interaction techniques and ubiquitous computing. He then went on to become Chief Scientist of SGI and Alias-Wavefront, where he had the opportunity to work with some of the top film makers and industrial designers in the world. He is now a principal researcher at Microsoft Corp., where he splits his time between research and helping make design a fundamental pillar of the corporate culture. <br>* Covers sketching and early prototyping design methods suitable for dynamic product capabilities: cell phones that communicate with each other and other embedded systems, \"smart\" appliances, and things you only imagine in your dreams; <br>* Thorough coverage of the design sketching method which helps easily build experience prototypes without the effort of engineering prototypes which are difficult to abandon; <br>* Reaches out to a range of designers, including user interface designers, industrial designers, software engineers, usability engineers, product managers, and others; <br>* Full of case studies, examples, exercises, and projects, and access to video clips that demonstrate the principles and methods."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["494245"],"name":["Bill Buxton"],"image_url":["http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1306726066p5/494245.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1306726066p2/494245.jpg"],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/494245.Bill_Buxton"],"average_rating":["3.92"],"ratings_count":["500"],"text_reviews_count":["44"]}]}],"published":["2007"]}],"rating":["3"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read"}}]}],"recommended_for":[{}],"recommended_by":[{}],"started_at":["Tue Mar 27 00:00:00 -0700 2012"],"read_at":["Tue Jun 12 10:59:23 -0700 2012"],"date_added":["Tue Mar 27 17:13:11 -0700 2012"],"date_updated":["Thu Jul 05 10:36:37 -0700 2012"],"read_count":[{}],"body":["\n      More on the theory and reasoning behind why and how to do sketches than the actual instruction I was looking for.\n  "],"comments_count":["review_comments_count"],"url":["http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/301931469"],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/301931469"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["299174241"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"41597","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0321193857"],"isbn13":["9780321193858"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"84","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["The Non-Designer's Design Book"],"image_url":["http://www.goodreads.com/assets/nocover/111x148.png"],"small_image_url":["http://www.goodreads.com/assets/nocover/60x80.png"],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41597.The_Non_Designer_s_Design_Book"],"num_pages":["191"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[" Second Edition"],"publisher":["Peachpit Press"],"publication_day":["28"],"publication_year":["2003"],"publication_month":["8"],"average_rating":["3.96"],"ratings_count":["1158"],"description":["So you have a great concept and all the fancy digital tools you could possibly require—what's stopping you from creating beautiful pages?

Swift suggests in his essay that the impoverished Irish might ease their economic troubles by selling children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies. By doing this he mocks the authority of the British officials. A Modest Proposal is included in many literature programs as an example of early modern western satire. It also serves as an exceptional introduction to the concept and use of argumentative language, lending itself well to secondary and post-secondary essay courses. Outside of the realm of English studies, A Modest Proposal is a relevant piece included in many comparative and global literature and history courses, as well as those of numerous other disciplines in the arts, humanities, and even the social sciences."],"authors":[{"author":[{"id":["1831"],"name":["Jonathan Swift"],"image_url":["http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1183238507p5/1831.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/authors/1183238507p2/1831.jpg"],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1831.Jonathan_Swift"],"average_rating":["3.62"],"ratings_count":["125124"],"text_reviews_count":["2858"]}]}],"published":["2008"]}],"rating":["4"],"votes":["0"],"spoiler_flag":["false"],"spoilers_state":["none"],"shelves":[{"shelf":[{"$":{"name":"read"}}]}],"recommended_for":[{}],"recommended_by":[{}],"started_at":[{}],"read_at":[{}],"date_added":["Sun Oct 23 09:52:26 -0700 2011"],"date_updated":["Sun Oct 23 09:52:26 -0700 2011"],"read_count":[{}],"body":[{}],"comments_count":["review_comments_count"],"url":["http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/226612410"],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/226612410"],"owned":["0"]},{"id":["226612272"],"book":[{"id":[{"_":"27539","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"isbn":["0805078533"],"isbn13":["9780805078534"],"text_reviews_count":[{"_":"179","$":{"type":"integer"}}],"title":["On Intelligence"],"image_url":["http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1316636430m/27539.jpg"],"small_image_url":["http://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1316636430s/27539.jpg"],"link":["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27539.On_Intelligence"],"num_pages":["272"],"format":["Paperback"],"edition_information":[{}],"publisher":["St. Martin's Griffin"],"publication_day":["1"],"publication_year":["2005"],"publication_month":["8"],"average_rating":["4.09"],"ratings_count":["1996"],"description":["<strong>From the inventor of the PalmPilot comes a new and compelling theory of intelligence, brain function, and the future of intelligent machines</strong><br><br>Jeff Hawkins, the man who created the PalmPilot, Treo smart phone, and other handheld devices, has reshaped our relationship to computers.
